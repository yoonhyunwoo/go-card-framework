# go-card-framework
This is a library designed to allow Go developers to treat the Chat API JSON to be generated for cards and dialogs as objects, each capable of rendering themselves into valid JSON instead of hand-crafting or cut-and-pasting JSON in large blocks.

The exact JSON that is being rendered can be found in the official Google Developer Docs pages here: https://developers.google.com/chat/api/reference/rest/v1/spaces.messages?hl=en
